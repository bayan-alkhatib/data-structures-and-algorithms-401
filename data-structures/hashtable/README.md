# Hashtables
data structure hat store data as key value pairs

## Challenge
to build hashtable class and define add, get and contains methods for it

## Approach & Efficiency
hash: time O(n), space O(1)
add:  time O(1), space O(1)
get:  time O(n)  space O(1)
contains: time O(n)  space O(1)

## API
hash:  method returns Index in the collection for that key

add: method that  hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

get: method returns Value associated with that key in the table.

contains:  method returns Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
