## Approach & Efficiency
Approach & Efficiency was choosen to be  big O for tom O(n) and space O(1)
## Solution
- append: Adds a node of a value to the end of LL
- insert after: Adds a node of a value after a specified value of LL
- insert before:Adds a node of a value before a specified value of LL



# challenge 5

## Singly Linked List

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

## Challenge

to build linked list dataa structure and add insert, include and str methods to it
Approach & Efficiency
approach was subsitution between head and next, big O (1)

## API
- insert: Adds a node of a value to the head of LL
- include: Return T/F if value is in the linked list or not 
- str: print linked list values
