## To Do List:

- [X] Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- [X] Within your LinkedList class, include a head property.
- [] Define a method called (insert) which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- [] Define a method called (includes )which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- [] Define a method called ( __str__)
- [] Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors.

## Tests: 
- [] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- [] Can properly insert into the linked list
- [] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- [] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- [] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- [] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- [] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
